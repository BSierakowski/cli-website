        <p>CONGRATULATIONS for successfully finding the easter egg on our website!</p>
            
        <p>Here's how to make use of the Root Ventures branded keypad:</p>
            
            <p>(1) Flip the keypad over.  Using the provided knife, slice through one of the traces on the back of the board that corresponds with the OS that your computer is running:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>MacOS = trace 1</li>
                <li>Windows = trace 2</li>
                <li>Ubuntu = trace 3</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>** tip for non-electrical engineers:  press down very hard with the knife, and scrape multiple times until you are sure the horizontal line of copper is fully broken.</p>
            
            <p>(2) Plug into your computer.</p>
            
            <p>(3) Enjoy!</p>
            
            <p>(4) Download the Arduino IDE and play around with mapping the keys to make them do whatever you want!  Original code can be found here:  <a href="https://github.com/rootvc/macro_keyboard">https://github.com/rootvc/macro_keyboard</a></p>
